# NeuroSED Experiments

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebooks used to run the experiments reported in the paper "A Neural Framework for Learning Graph and Subgraph Similarity Measures". The notebooks have paths and configurations which are custom to our setup, but these can easily be adapted to experiment in general settings.

## Directory descriptions

1. `nbs_train`: train various models

2. `nbs_pred`: make predictions using the trained models

3. `nbs_regress`: regression experiments

4. `nbs_rank`: ranking experiments

5. `nbs_range`: range query experiments

6. `nbs_index`: retrieval experiments using index structures
